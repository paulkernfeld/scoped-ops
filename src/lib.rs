//! This repo is a ðŸ’¥ FAILED ðŸ’¥ ergonomics experiment on a way to temporarily and reversibly modify
//! data structures in Rust.
//!
//! ## The Concept
//!
//! The idea is that it lets you hand a data structure off to another piece of code saying "okay,
//! you can modify this data while you're using it, but you have to put it back to the way you found
//! it." Here's a simple example of letting a user function change a Vec, and having the change
//! automatically undone:
//!
//! ```
//! use scoped_ops::borrowed::{VecScoped, Noop};
//!
//! let user_fn = |a: &mut Noop<Vec<i32>>| {
//!     // these operations modify the Vec in place
//!     let mut b = a.pushed(4);
//!     let c = b.assigned(1, -2);
//!
//!     // the user can now view the changed version of the Vec
//!     assert_eq!([1, -2, 3, 4], *c);
//! };  // c and b drop, and undo their changes
//!
//! let mut a = vec![1, 2, 3];
//! user_fn(&mut a.nooped());
//! assert_eq!([1, 2, 3], *a);
//! ```
//!
//! ## The Approach
//!
//! The approach here gives each mutating operation a scope, reverting the operation when it goes
//! out of scope. So once the operation goes out of scope, the state of the data structure will be
//! returned to what it was before the scoped operation was applied (except for maybe like the
//! capacity of a `Vec` could be different, or something like that). Because each operation is
//! reverted when it goes out of scope, operations can be nested without complication. Conceptually
//! this is like a weaker version of a partially persistent data structure. Unlike in a partially
//! persistent data structure, you can't actually "see" any past state; you have to apply undo
//! operations until you get back to that state.
//!
//! ## The Promise
//!
//! I thought this would be a kind of promising idea:
//!
//! - Uses normal Rust data structures, so can be integrated into existing code
//! - Hopefully zero-cost abstraction, although inspection would be needed to verify this
//! - No dependencies, could work without `std`
//!
//! ## The Reality
//!
//! Unfortunately, this didn't end up being as cool as I envisioned. Why did it fail?
//!
//! - I can't find a real-world use case for this!
//! - Using generics is "viral:" any code that uses this will also need to be generic. This makes
//!   something like looping or recursion a lot harder. You'll also end up with complex nested types
//!   like when using futures or iterators.
//! - Using mutable references, users will need to create too many `let` bindings.
//! - These reversions could in many cases just be coded by hand instead.
//!
//! ## The Alternatives
//!
//! Instead of using this approach, I can think of a few possible alternatives for temporarily and
//! reversibly modifying data:
//!
//! - Ask the user to undo their own changes to the data structure
//! - Just clone the data, then the user can can modify the clone however they want
//! - Apply adapters around the original data structure at read time. For example, you could have a
//!   `VecPushed` that has most of the same methods as `Vec`, but acts as if it has an element
//!   pushed onto the end. For example, if the underlying `Vec` has length 2, the `VecPushed` would
//!   say that its length is 3. Possible disadvantages:
//!   - A lot of code to implement
//!   - Applying a lot of modifications, or certain kinds of modifications, might hurt performance
//!   - You couldn't get a slice, because the data doesn't actually exist in memory
//!
//! ## The Conclusions
//!
//! What I've learned:
//!
//! - Using generics for zero-cost abstractions introduces a usability penalty, because any user
//!   code needs to use the generics. For example, this makes looping pretty annoying.
//! - Using references can be annoying because it limits you to structuring your code so that the
//!   lifetimes work out. In the doctest, I need to create additional `let` bindings that I'd rather
//!   omit.
//! - It's kind of hard to search for "where would this pattern be useful?" I don't know of a good
//!   way to search the entire Rust ecosystem for "unnecessarily cloning a `Vec`" for example.
//! - It's harder to find a problem for a solution than to find a solution to a problem.
//! - Even a failed experiment helped me learn a lot about structuring Rust code. For example, I
//!   learned about:
//!   - It's hard to have both `Drop` and a method that takes `self`
//!   - When to use associated types vs. generic types
//!   - How to emulate a [sealed trait](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/future-proofing.html)
//!   - `&mut T` is not [`UnwindSafe`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/panic/trait.UnwindSafe.html),
//!     meaning I can't test panics with this crate (without learning more about unwind safety).
//!
//! # The Future
//!
//! A few possible interesting angles on future exploration:
//!
//! - Check whether this is actually, as I hoped, a zero-cost abstraction
//! - Figure out if this would actually be useful for anything ðŸ˜‚
//! - Explore support for "commit vs. revert"
//! - Add more operations to `Vec`
//! - Add support for other data structures
//! - Explore a reference-counted variant
//!
//! Thanks to mjhoy for contributing the `Assign` operation, and thanks to everyone on
//! [the URLO thread](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/pattern-for-nested-mutable-references/45651) who
//! suggested great solutions for nesting mutable types!
